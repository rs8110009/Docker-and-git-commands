***************************************************************************	 Proxy Server in Linux ***********************************************************************************************************

A proxy Server is an intemediate between a client and Internet.
In simple terms:  we send request to the proxy > proxy sends it to the destination (Website) > Recieves the response and send back to us.

Why we use proxy server?

i) Privacy: Hides Our Real IP from website, website see the proxy ip not our server IP.
ii) Access Control: Used by Organization to restrict or allow internet access for certain users or sites.
iii) Caching: Stores copies of frequently accessed web content to improve load time and reduce bandwidth usage.
iv) Security: filters traffic, blocks malicious sites, and can log user activity.
v) By Pass Geo Restrications: Let you access content that's blocked in your country by using proxy in another region.

Types of Proxy Servers:

i) Forward Proxy: sites between internal users and internet.

iii) Transparent Proxy: Users are not aware they are using proxy, commonly used by ISP  or companies for monitoring
